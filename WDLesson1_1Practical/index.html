    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web technolgies</h1>

<h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It consists of "tags" that a web browser reads to display text, images, and other content as a web page, defining its structure rather than its appearance or interactivity.</p>
